# Presto docs

This folder is the project’s living documentation.

- Start here: [Controls](CONTROLS.md)
- How it works: [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Media keys / `playerctl`: [MPRIS integration](MPRIS.md)

Recent additions worth knowing about:
- The library scan extracts tags (title/artist/album) + duration when available.
- MPRIS metadata is richer than just a title (artist/album/url/length/trackid).
